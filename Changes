	* README, lib/LEOCHARRE/CLI2.pm, lib/LEOCHARRE/CLI2.pod: Improved
	  README file, some people say they look at the README file before
	  they check out the POD on cpan to see what the heck the distro is
	  about, humph.. but..	ok..

	  Cleaned up documentation in pod.

	  This module uses some magick for automatically detecting and
	  triggering on -h, -v etc..  So, under #!/usr/bin/perl -w was
	  emitting some false warnings. Took care of that.
